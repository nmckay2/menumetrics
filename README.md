We know it's hard to plan a good diet when you are on the run. When all you have time for is a quick stop at the nearest fast food restaurant, Menu Metrics uses your GPS to pull up the menu of whatever restaurant you are at! Just open up the app, confirm your location and view your restaurants menu sorted by any health concern you wish, be it sodium, fat, or sugar!
